**Why am I sharing this library?**<br/>
Just so that your learning path becomes a bit smoother.
Knowledge hidden inside my head or codes in a private code-library will be more useful if it shared. Also, Thanks to the CSE department for challenging and beautiful questions.<br/>
>**Also, you can make me happy just by giving a star to the repository.**

I believe that the codes are understandable. Add pull requests if there are any changes. <br/>
Good Luck
