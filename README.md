**Why am I sharing this library?**<br/>
Just so that your learning path becomes a bit smoother.
Knowledge hidden inside my head or codes in a private code-library will be useless when I am dead, so it's better to share those among people before I die. Also, Thanks to the CSE department for challenging and beautiful questions.<br/>
**Also, you can make me happy just by giving a star to the repository.**

I believe that my coding style is pretty clean and readable, add pull requests if there are any changes. <br/>
Good Luck
