Given a number N, write a Java program to compute first N Fibonacci series.The program also takes the range s and r as input to compute the sum of the fibonacci series between s and r from the above generated series.

Input Format

The first Line contain the integer N The second line contain the integer s The third line contains the integer r

Constraints

N >=r or s

Output Format

Prints the sum of the fibonacci series between s and r

Sample Input 0

5
3
5
Sample Output 0

6
Explanation 0

The Fibonacci series is a series of elements where the previous two elements are added to get the next element, starting with 0 and 1. When N=5 Fibonacci serie Generated 0 1 1 2 3 For s=3 and r=5 The Sum is = 1+2+3 =6
